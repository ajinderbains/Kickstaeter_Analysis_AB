### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- To find outcomes based on launch date,I have to convert launched date column to DATE format,for which i struggled a bit but evantually found the correct formula.

-I also have challanged to separate the parent and subcategory as in given data set it is in same column.

-If I have given chance then i would have used filter on subcategory "play " to find the outcome VS launch date instead of parent category "theater".

-If I would have to change the theater outcome VS launch date then i would have found percentages(Averages) of outcome.


## Results

Based on this analysis,following are results which will be helpful for Louise to decide to kickstart her campaign.

- Campaigns should be started in the months of May and June as there is more chances of to be successful.

- Campaign goal amount should be less than $5000 or between $35000 and $45999.

- Campaign goal should not be more than $45000 as there is 94% chances for failure.

- Campaign should not be started in last quarter of year as this is clear from chart  "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch date" ,campaigns are less successful.
